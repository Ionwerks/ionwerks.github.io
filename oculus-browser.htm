	<h3>Issue with JavaScript 'prompt' in Oculus Browser</h3>
	<p>In desktop versions of Chrome the expected behaviour is seen in that the last text entered via the prompt is displayed by default the next time the prompt appears.</p>
	<p>In the Oculus Browser this does not occur. Instead whatever was entered the <i>first</i> time the prompt was shown is always the default text thereafter (parameter for default text is ignored).</p>
	<button onclick="settext(this);">Enter Text to Persist</button>
